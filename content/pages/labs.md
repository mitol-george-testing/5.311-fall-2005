The experiments for 5.311 have evolved over a period of many years and include contributions from past instructors, course textbooks, and others affiliated with the course. For many of these lab documents, no single source can be attributed. Dr. Mircea Gheorghiu is the primary author of certain documents, as noted below. Additionally, he designed the experiment for ionic liquid acylation of ferrocene. In the Unknown Aromatic Carboxylic Acid experiment, Dr. Gheorghiu authored the section on calculating the second derivative and Gran's plot.
